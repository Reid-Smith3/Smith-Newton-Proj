## [THE GOAT PROJECT!!]
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2020)
Why isn't this working?

### About
For our final project, we decided to build a movie recommendation algorithm. We both love movies, but the current recommendation algorithms used by industry giants, like Netflix, Xfinity, and Hulu, aren't that good. We wanted to create an algorithm for movie watchers like us. To this end, we designed an algorithm that is predicated on data analysis and user inputs. That is, we want the recommendor to output movies that are solely based on user inputs and nothing else. We hope you're able to use this algorithm to find some great new movies.
