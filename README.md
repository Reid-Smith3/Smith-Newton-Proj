## [Christian Reid Movie Algorithm (CRMA)]
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2020)

### ABOUT
For our final project, we decided to build a movie recommendation algorithm. We both love movies, but the current recommendation algorithms used by industry giants, like Netflix, Xfinity, and Hulu, aren't that good. We wanted to create an algorithm for movie watchers like us. To this end, we designed an algorithm that is predicated on data analysis and user inputs. That is, we want the recommendor to output movies that are solely based on user inputs and nothing else. We hope you're able to use this algorithm to find some great new movies.

### BUILDING
Ready to get going? Begin by navigating to our repository and clicking the green download button in the top right corner of your browser. Download all of the code as a zip file and open it up. Inside of the folder, you should see the following files: correlation.pickle, credentials.json, logofinal.jpg, main.py, ReadMe.md, savedlist.txt, and token.pickle. We want our algorithm to be simple and easy to use, so the only file you have to worry about is main.py. The only other file you should pay attention to is the saved list file. Once you run our algorithm and save some movies, they'll be stored here in this file!

Start by opening up main.py in a Python IDE and clicking run. Having some trouble seeing the Info and Search buttons? Go to line 417 of the code and try adjusting the height=600 line to see what works for your screen. Once you see our logo, the Info button, and the search button, you're good to go!

### USAGE
Stuck? No problem. To get started, click the search button on the bottom of the opening page. This will bring you to our main page, and you'll be able to enter the genres, years, and rating range of your choice. Click search, and you'll see a list of movies pop up. From here, it's all up to you! You can search again, exit the search, or try and click the plus button to the right of movie. Once you've hit the plus button next to a couple of movies, hit the save list button on the bottom and then hit search again. Once you're back at the main page, hit view list, and your customized movie playlist will pop up. If you don't like one of the movies you've added, click the minus button and then refresh the page. If you love all your movies, click the save list button. Check your directory where all of these files are stored, and you'll find a .txt files of your movies!

Don't forget to also give our advanced search features a try. Either enter your favorite movie, or go out on a limb and hit deep dive for some lesser-known classics. If you're still stuck, we'll give you some hints. Some of our favorite inputs are Action, Adventure, War from 1980 to 2020 with a rating of six and above. Date night? Go with Romance and Comedy from 1985 to 2015 with a rating of four and above.

If you're still stuck, you're hopeless. Just kidding. Head to this link [here](https://midd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=985e345a-0238-4cf0-a1bb-ac860130a55d) and go to 19 minutes and 55 seconds. Still stuck? Go to Rotten Tomatoes; we give up.

### LIMITATIONS
The one heads up we'll give you is that sometimes, based on your search input, the algorithm can take a couple seconds to run. Also, sometimes startup can take five seconds. Oh no! You'll have to look up from your laptop for a little.
